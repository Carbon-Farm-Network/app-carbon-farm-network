# Carbon Farm Network

## Environment Setup

> PREREQUISITE: set up the [holochain development environment](https://developer.holochain.org/docs/install/).

Enter the nix shell by running this in the root folder of the repository: 

```bash
nix develop
npm install
```

**Run all the other instructions in this README from inside this nix-shell, otherwise they won't work**.

## Running 2 agents
 
```bash
npm start
```

This will create a network of 2 nodes connected to each other and their respective UIs.
It will also bring up the Holochain Playground for advanced introspection of the conductors.

## Running the backend tests

```bash
npm test
```

## Bootstrapping a network

Create a custom network of nodes connected to each other and their respective UIs with:

```bash
AGENTS=3 npm run network
```

Substitute the "3" for the number of nodes that you want to bootstrap in your network.
This will also bring up the Holochain Playground for advanced introspection of the conductors.

## Packaging

To package the web happ:
``` bash
npm run package
```

You'll have the `acfn.webhapp` in `workdir`. This is what you should distribute so that the Holochain Launcher can install it.
You will also have its subcomponent `acfn.happ` in the same folder`.
